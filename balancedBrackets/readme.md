write a function that takes a string of brackets and returns true or false depending on whether the brackets are balanced.
 For example, "[{()}]" would return true.

 "([{}]()" would return false.

 Each subsequent closing bracket has to match the next closest opening bracket, such that
 "{[{(})]}" would return false, even though there is an even number of open and closed brackets of each type.
